This is my home on the web!

I am an internatonal research and development professional with a broad ranging
experience in aerospace engineering discipline, who has demonstrated
both relatonship-building and technology development leadership skills.
My work revolves around intelligent monitoring of failures and false alarms in electronic
systems. I was awarded the JSPS fellowship in 2016 and is currently working with the
artfcial intelligence group at the University of Tokyo, on the application of deep learning algorithms in aerospace
applicatons. I was a lecturer at Coventry University UK, and had also worked as a research fellow
on fault detecton and isolaton research at Cranfeld University UK, where I led a number of
projects related to aerospace maintenance. My work was characterised by strong industrial
collaboraton, having worked with companies such as Rolls-Royce, Jaguar Land Rover, BAE Systems,
MoD, and this was supported by excellent links with other universites and research organisatons
worldwide. Prior to this role, I also worked at Thales Transportaton as a Systems Engineer, where I
was responsible for performing reliablity analysis and fault monitoring from track-side feedback
sensors.

My main research interests are focused on real-time systems, arttficial intelligence, deep
learning, embedded systems and digital control. I am a Fellow of UK higher educaton, a Chartered
engineer and a member of the Insttuton of Engineering and Technology and Insttute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers.

This website includes almost everything that I am involved with in my research and teaching, as well most of what I write. It started off as a modest attempt to capture my work as I move ahead... so has grown over time. I have tried to collect as much content as I can into this site... which means that navigating it might be a challenge.
