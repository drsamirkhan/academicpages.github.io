This is my home on the web!

My work revolves around intelligent monitoring of failures in electronic systems. I currently work at artificial intelligence group at the University of Tokyo, on the application of deep learning algorithms. My main research interests are focused on real-time systems, artificial intelligence, deep learning, embedded systems and digital control. I am a Fellow of UK higher educaton, a Chartered engineer and a member of the Instituton of Engineering and Technology and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

This website includes almost everything that I am involved with in my research and teaching, as well most of what I write. It started off as a modest attempt to capture my work as I move ahead... so has grown over time. I have tried to collect as much content as I can into this site... which means that navigating it might be a challenge.
