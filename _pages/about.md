This is my home on the web!

My work revolves around intelligent monitoring, AI-based control, perception and planning in the context of autonomous systems and service robots, with a focus on embedded hardware implementation of machine learning techniques for anomaly detection and prognostics and system health management. I have developed algorithms using Matlab, python and VHDL, and carried out hardware prototyping using various Xilinx products and embedded controllers. I also have experience in several tools, and methodologies used to design integrated circuits for real-time digital control, its physical verification, and technology CAD.

I am a Fellow of UK higher education, a Chartered Engineer and a member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
I currently work at artificial intelligence group at the University of Tokyo. My main research interests are focused on real-time systems, artificial intelligence, FPGAs, embedded systems and digital control.

This website includes almost everything that I am involved with in my research and teaching, as well most of what I write. It started off as a modest attempt to capture my work as I move ahead... so has grown over time. I have tried to collect as much content as I can into this site... which means that navigating it might be a challenge.
