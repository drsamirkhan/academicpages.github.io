excerpt: 'Given the advancements in modern technological capabilities, having an integrated health management and diagnostic strategy becomes an important part of a systemâ€™s operational life-cycle. This is because it can be used to detect anomalies, analyse failures and predict the future state based on up-to-date information. By utilising condition data and on-site feedback, data models can be trained using machine learning and statistical concepts. Once trained, the logic for data processing can be embedded on on-board controllers whilst enabling real-time health assessment and analysis. However, this integration inevitably faces several difficulties and challenges for the community; indicating the need for novel approaches to address this vexing issue. Deep learning has gained increasing attention due to its potential advantages with data classification and feature extraction problems. It is an evolving research area with diverse application domains and hence its use for system health management applications must been researched if it can be used to increase overall system resilience or potential cost benefits for maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities. This article presents a systematic review of artificial intelligence based system health management with an emphasis on recent trends of deep learning within the field. Various architectures and related theories are discussed to clarify its potential. Based on the reviewed work, deep learning demonstrates plausible benefits for fault diagnosis and prognostics. However, there are a number of limitations that hinder its widespread adoption and require further development. Attention is paid to overcoming these challenges, with future opportunities being enumerated.'
