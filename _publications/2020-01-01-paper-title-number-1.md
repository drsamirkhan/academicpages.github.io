excerpt: 'Augmented reality (AR) applications have opened innovative ways for performance improvement in the IoT industry. It can enhance user perception of the real-world by providing valuable information. This article presents how odors and scents in an industrial environment can be used to provide visual virtual information onto a head-mounted device (HMD). Such information is important for maintainers to quickly detect abnormalities. Since odors are made up of volatile compounds at low concentration, they can be identified by using sensors whose outputs reach specific values depending on the number of volatile compounds. An electronic nose, composed of three gas sensors is developed for the purposes of air analysis. The device is integrated with AR smart glasses (Microsoft HoloLens). Results are then sent through a local network to the HMD and displayed with other relevant information concerning the diagnosed odor. To validate the device, four odors including engine oil, sun lotion, medical alcohol and perfume have been analyzed. The experiments recorded miscellaneous behaviors of each sample to demonstrate the repeatability of the process. The presented technology incorporates sampling methods, cleaning processes and statistical analysis that can be further scrutinized to allow correct smell identification.'
