excerpt: 'This article investigates a process that has been developed to estimate performance based support contract costs attributed to corrective maintenance. These can play a dominant role in the through-life support of high values assets. The case context for the paper is the UK Ministry of Defence. The developed approach allows benchmarking support contract solutions, and enabling efficient planning decisions. Emphasis is placed on learning from feedback, testing and validating current methodologies for estimating corrective maintenance costs and availability at the Equipment Type level. These are interacting sub-equipments that have unique availability requirements and hence have a much larger impact on the capital maintenance expenditure. The presented case studies demonstrate the applicability of the approach towards adequate savings and improved availability estimates.'
