One of my fondest memories of my early academic life is hanging around with my fellow aspiring researchers at the coffee shop and discussing wacky ideas. These ideas weren’t always ground breaking and we certainly weren’t going to change the world... but these meetups promoted our creative thought and motivated us in various ways to do competitive research.

I will soon complete two years of leaving my academic career in the UK. I was an aspiring academic who just wanted to do research, publish my work, do some teaching, manage my students/projects and get appreciated for my work... and i was on course of becoming successful too. Yet, after struggling for 6 years, i had had enough of the uk academic system.

“With a career as short as yours, how much is your opinion worth?”
