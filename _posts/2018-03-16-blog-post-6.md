In my experience, the superior professor, is he or she who resists the throes of arrogance to do even more than what comes easy. And that requires throwing off the cloak of invincibility to show the willingness to fail, the perseverance to succeed, and the humility to invite others into exploring the fuzzy edges of the universe. I do not characterize any of my PhD professors as arrogant, even though they are top in their fields and can afford to be snobbish about it. They are brilliant scholars, extraordinary researchers and, most of all, inspiring academics who convinced me to become an academic, showed me how to use my innate abilities, and not just flaunt my own. Its just the latter experiences in my life with a selected few that has beenâ€¦ less than extraordinary.
