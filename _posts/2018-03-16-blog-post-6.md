Are university Professors more or less arrogant or are they just paid to be smart and applauded for merely being themselves? It does seem some academics are altruistic, a couple of them will turn out to be geniuses, while the rest are… well you know… less competent. Of course, like any other field, there are academics who are arrogant; who will put others down and place themselves on a pedestal.

Let me get this out of the way first… consider the assertion of a simple, quantifiable claim such as: Professor X has a bazillion number of (last author) publications in top journals for the next REF. But what amount of effort does it takes to hold the “professor” title? what quality of work does a single publication represent? or what is the importance of research money in one's career? These are typical questions that all academics speculate when quantifying research outputs. This can easily be misconstrued as undue self-importance and arrogance... simply because the statement itself seemingly tries to convince the reader that these metrics are relevant or important. This is not the kind of arrogance I want to talk about here.

A simple Google search of the definition of arrogance is: "having or revealing an exaggerated sense of one’s own importance or abilities" - and that can happen anywhere where one's abilities are critical to one's job; whether its in engineering, law, medicine, politics, sports, entertainment, and business. However, in academia I suspect that the abilities are not so much acquired nor developed… which can lead to have an exaggerate sense of superiority. We all know that research requires a lot of self-confidence. There are many very smart people working in universities right now, yet to be successful, we have to come up with ideas that no one has ever had before, and we have to simultaneously convince our peers that our ideas are "worthy". When we give talks about our work, people question our choices, and we need to be prepared to defend them. If some one thinks that they can’t do it, they are not likely to survive in academia, and are likely to leave soon after. But its still unclear to me precisely why some British professors, at times, would need to act like jackasses (there... I said it!). In my experience… a huge majority of them suffer from a terrible intellectual superiority complex – which probably varies by field, school, personality type, level of talent, level of achievement, etc. I've met some great minds who are very modest, but mostly who weren't.

In fact, you will realise that most of these arrogant professors won't go around saying, "I'm just better than everyone else because of their "I know it all" attitude. To a certain extent, all academics do hope that others around them have a certain level of understanding... yet we often forget that we were not born with it either. It might be really obvious to us now but there was a time when we didn't know about these things ourselves, and that it might have been hard to learn. So we do get trapped thinking that knowing about - some random thing - is just the natural state of being. Although, this is not my issue. My problem is, what I have already mentioned in my previous rant, is when professors start pretending that they are business executives who are managing some kind of a billion dollar investment and actually earn by selling things (instead of taxpayers' money). This makes the rest of us (young academics) somehow intellectually beneath those in the ivory tower. 

If you are like me when you started working in academia, you would have thought that everyone should seek knowledge instead of profit, right? Your wrong! At least in the UK. The way the system has been setup is often covered up in insecurities. What makes this particularly annoying is that first, these professors have a lot of credibility, often undeserved. I will repeat myself and say that half-baked ideas aren't alien to universities which are often taken seriously. You can argue that there is some political agenda with their acceptance – otherwise why would they be allowed to continue; or is the academic management just that stupid? I dropped out of a good research project because of this and decided to move away from such issues. The true is, communism was an academic invention brought about by intellectuals, and to this day, its ideology is still being manufactured in school of engineering’s ivory towers (though many may only come to realize it after the ideas have done their damage through the minds and actions of sick men!). But you can't blame them all for those things. A few of them professors simply tow the party line. They may share a common ideological base… and they're not that impressive as a whole, but again, this isn't everybody. 

“For the same reason that wrestlers are so muscular: they have to be…” 

Now don't tell me that a Professor needs to be arrogant as part of their job description. No. They don't have to be overly critical, egoistic, manipulative and liars. I understand that I am probably painting a very grim portrait of of UK professors over here, but let’s look at some characteristics that I have noticed about the Professors I classify as arrogant: 

1) They seem to possess excess power than they deserve in their schools;

2) They have spent all their lives working only at one university;

3) They worked in industry for most of their lives and then decided to become professors before a few years retirement… probably to extend their career;

4) They don't know how to teach hence they feel the need to show off;

5)They try to capitalise and take credit of another researcher’s hard work.

I know most people will agree with the above, and I know that some would feel offended, and some who would agree but wouldn't see a problem with it. Its a mixed bad, but not as mixed as it ought to me. Certainly, crazy, as long as it stays close to the dogma, can go far in UK academia.

“All those things that weren't supposed to happen... they happened. What happens next is up to you”

In my experience, the superior professor, is he or she who resists the throes of arrogance to do even more than what comes easy. And that requires throwing off the cloak of invincibility to show the willingness to fail, the perseverance to succeed, and the humility to invite others into exploring the fuzzy edges of the universe. I do not characterize any of my PhD professors as arrogant, even though they are top in their fields and can afford to be snobbish about it. They are brilliant scholars, extraordinary researchers and, most of all, inspiring academics who convinced me to become an academic, showed me how to use my innate abilities, and not just flaunt my own. Its just the latter experiences in my life with a selected few that has been… less than extraordinary.

I don’t know how I got here, but this is where I am.
