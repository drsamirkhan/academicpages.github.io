“Words are the source of misunderstandings”

First people complain when scientist don't communicate in simple terms to the non-scientific public and then when we do, people complain that we are no longer doing science. You can't win! Like everyone, as we grow older, we enter into a more reflective stage of our lives where popularising our research is a valuable contribution. The fight to get and maintain research funding gets far less attractive with more younger minds, to whom the current technology is second nature, are generally better at finding new and innovative ways to explore nature. Being a scientist is no doubt about finding a refined and rigorous way of thinking about the world... and that does not go away.
