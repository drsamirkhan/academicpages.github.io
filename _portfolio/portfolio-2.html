title: "Collaborative autonomous robotics for maintenance"
excerpt: "This project was about automating a maintenance tasking, with an investigation into methods for capturing and classifying maintenance processes and decomposing them into ‘unit tasks’ for future automation. This helps designers in linking these unit tasks with automation during conceptual design of autonomous robotic platforms. These concepts were demonstrated using multiple collaborative mobile manipulator robots (Turtlebots) to perform the simple industrial maintenance task using.
