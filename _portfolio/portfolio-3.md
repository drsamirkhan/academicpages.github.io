title: "Non-uniform sampling strategies for digital control"
excerpt: "Most conventional control algorithms cause numerical problems where data is collected at sampling rates that are substantially higher than the dynamics of the equivalent continuous-time operation that is being implemented. This is of relevant interest in applications of digital control, in which high sample rates are routinely dictated by the system stability requirements rather than the signal processing needs. Digital control systems exhibit bandwidth limitations enforced by their closed-loop frequency requirements that demand very high sample rates. Considerable recent progress in reducing sample frequency requirements has been made through the use of non-uniform sampling schemes, so called alias-free signal processing. The approach prompts the simplification of complex systems and consequently enhances the numerical conditioning of the implementation algorithms that otherwise would require very high uniform sample rates. However, the control communities have not yet investigated the use of intentional non-uniform sampling. The purpose of this article is to address some algorithmic issues when using such regimes for digital control."

My PhD dissertation focused developing signal processing strategies for non-linear digital control applications. I had argued the traditional approaches of sampling information for real time control and proposed algorithms for processing non-uniformly sampled data. The larger question of why novel approaches are necessary for real-time control applications steered me towards systems of complexity. My efforts have since then been praised for introducing alternative algorithms for the control community to process information. This work optimised the control design, and verified this through an experimental prototype. It focused on design theories from concept to detailed design, mathematical modelling and optimisation algorithms. Due to the success of my studies and the strength of my dissertation, I was offered an industrial opportunity with Thales Transportation as a Systems Engineer. Here, I was able gain useful experience whilst working in teams to design and develop circuit models and analyse fault data. This included an in-depth study on the type of faults occurring on the signalling assets being used, and validating the models. These results were feedback as recommendations to improve the existing industrial design plans.

The focus had been placed upon two issues – the development of the non-uniform sampling algorithm and the frequency response analysis. The work emphasised the importance of choosing a suitable implementation structure for intentional non-uniform sampling, and illustrates that the ‘conventional’ functions using the shift operator are not appropriate, identifying instead the use of the -operator, which avoids critical algorithmic problems. In addition, the problem of estimating the frequency response characteristics when utilising the non-uniform sampling algorithm was addressed. Of course, time simulations can be used for control design, even with non-uniform sampling, but frequency domain and root locus are commonly used. The authors have not yet considered how root locus design could be done under the nonuniform sampling conditions, but this article shows how the frequency response can be calculated using an adaptation of the Fourier analysis. It should be noted that uniform sampling is still the most preferable method to execute tasks due to its simplicity and scope, and this research study has not highlighted any distinct advantages of non-uniform sampling that will differentiate the choice of its suitability for a control application. However, this work has brought forward some specific digital control issues and attempted to initiate and expand the scope of intentional non-uniform sampling in this subject for research.
