title: ["Application of deep learning in system health management"](https://www.google.com)
excerpt: "I am investigating various deep learning architectures including autoencoders and recurrent neural networks so that they can used for fault detection and isolation. This becomes important in the systems development life cycle if artificial
intelligence is to be used to detect anomalies, analyse faults/failures and predict the remaining
useful life of system components. By utilising historical data, data models are trained using machine
learning and statistical concepts. Once trained, the logic for data processing can be embedded on
on-board microcontrollers whilst enabling real-time health assessment and analysis. The work has a
focus towards aerospace applications, for increasing overall system resilience and potential cost
benefits for maintenance, repair and overhaul activities."
